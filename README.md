# Idena-lite
A web wallet original based on Idena-pocket built by [@idena-dev](https://github.com/idena-dev)

```Original Idena-pocket wallet is available at https://pocket.idena.dev```

### Overview
Idena-pocket and Idena-lite are both based on Idena-js library developed by [@idena-dev](https://github.com/idena-dev). 
Idena-JS is built with typescript.
These wallets do not need an active node needed to run. 
They are using ```rpc.idena.dev``` as the reference endpoint since their is no public rpc endpoint available.

rpc.idena.dev is built and maintained by [@idena-dev](https://github.com/idena-dev/idena-pocket)

### Will this be opensource?
I was impressed by original idena-pocket project and decided to enhance it from usability and interaction design standpoint. 
Idena-lite will be 100% opensource. Feel free to fork it, contribute to it. PRs are welcome.
